        <h3>Instagram DBMS makes it possible for to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible. At Instagram we use MySQL to manage many petabytes of data, along with the Inno DB storage engine that serves social activities such as likes, comments, and shares.<br>
            Instagram tracks its users across the web by using tracking cookies. If a user is logged into Instagram and simultaneously browses other websites, Instagram can track the sites they are visiting.</h3>
